testing is one of the most important areas of engineering. This portion of the 
Aerospace and Ocean Lab course is intended to introduce students to standard 
testing techniques while exploring the experimental characteristics of wings. <A 
href="http://www.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3054/manual/app3/index.html" 
target=_parent>Appendix 3</A> provides a broad overview of methods and specific 
information describing aerodynamic testing. <I>We suggest you keep this material 
for future use. If you work in this area after graduation, it will be very 
helpful!</I> This chapter provides one specific example of the pretest 
preparation, test, and data evaluation required in an engineering test. The 
procedures used in aerodynamic testing are in many ways representative of many 
engineering test activities. Engineering testing is extremely expensive, and the 
procedures have evolved to ensure test objectives are achieved while keeping the 
test costs to a minimum. Detailed pretest preparation is a critical part of that 
procedure, which for this experiment is described in <A 
href="http://www.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3054/manual/expt7/text.html#T7">section 
7</A> of this chapter. You will find that the preparation required for 
experiment 7 is more extensive and specific than any other. It is important, 
therefore, to get organized to distribute the work load <I>well in advance</I> 
of the experiment and organize a wind tunnel visit before your test.

<CENTER><FONT size=4><A name=T2>2. Wing 
Characteristics</A></FONT></CENTER><BR>Design for good wing aerodynamic 
characteristics is one of the most fundamental considerations in airplane 
design. The results obtained are also valid for hydrodynamic surfaces as long as 
cavitation and ventilation are not present. In this test you will examine both 
the performance and flying qualities characteristics of a wing. Performance is 
evaluated by measuring the drag and the maximum lift coefficient. The aircraft 
stability and flight characteristics are primarily determined by the lift and 
pitching moment characteristics. 
<P>Drag is usually considered to be divided into the minimum drag, frequently 
called zero lift drag, <I>C<SUB>D<SUB>0</SUB></SUB></I>, and the drag due to 
lift. The drag due to lift is further broken up into induced drag and additional 
profile drag. The induced drag is a function of the wing spanload only, and is 
independent of the details of the particular airfoil used in the wing. The 
additional profile drag is associated with the airfoil used in the wing. At low 
lift coefficients this drag should be small, only becoming important as flow 
separation starts to develop on the airfoil section. The additional profile drag 
becomes large as wing stall is approached. 
<P>Wing performance is evaluated based on the ability to obtain a high value of 
the lift to drag ratio, (<I>L/D</I>), relative to the maximum possible for that 
planform, and the ability to achieve a high maximum lift coefficient. 
Essentially, the wing should be designed to allow the airfoil to achieve its 
full performance. Recalling that in potential flow theory a two-dimensional 
airfoil has no drag due to lift, the maximum performance should occur by adding 
the induced drag, assuming an elliptic spanload, to the zero lift drag (this 
would be known as the 100% suction polar, since the airfoil section has no 
additional profile drag due to lift, and is thus achieving 100% of the leading 
edge suction required to eliminate the drag force in a two-dimensional flow), 
<FONT face=Symbol>D</FONT><I>C<SUB>D</SUB></I> = 
<I>C<SUB>L</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>/(<IMG height=13 src="text.files/pi.gif" 
width=11>AR)</I>. At the other extreme, the worst case occurs when the airfoil 
fails to produce any efficient lift, such that the only force is normal to the 
surface and there is no edge or suction force (0% leading edge suction). In this 
case the entire lifting force on the wing is the normal force, and the polar can 
be determined by resolving that force into lift and drag components {<I><IMG 
height=30 src="text.files/delta.gif" width=14 align=top>C<SUB>D</SUB> = 
C<SUB>L</SUB> tan(<FONT face=Symbol>a</FONT> - <FONT 
face=Symbol>a</FONT><SUB>0</SUB>)</I>}. In any experimental evaluation of wing 
performance both the 100% and 0% polars should be constructed, and used to 
establish bounds on the experimental polar. For unswept wings, the span 
efficiency, <I>e</I>, predicted based on lifting line analysis should also be 
contained on the drag polar estimate. 
<P>It is difficult to identify the initial flow breakdown using the drag polar. 
A better way of examining wing performance is available by plotting axial force 
as a function of normal force. In this plot the axial force should initially 
decrease. When the airfoil section starts to loose leading edge suction (in 
essence a failure to fully enforce the Kutta condition, leading to less 
circulation than theoretically required) the data should display a sharp 
"break." This can be used to identify the initial loss of airfoil performance. 
This illustrates the loss of aerodynamic efficiency due to flow separation. 
<P>The stability of the wing is determined by measuring the pitching moment 
characteristics and examining the slope of the pitching moment with respect to 
angle of attack and lift coefficient. At low angles of attack the curve should 
be linear, and the slope of the curve with respect to the lift coefficient can 
be used to determine the aerodynamic center of the wing. The behavior of the 
pitching moment curve at wing stall and the "break" of the lift curve with angle 
of attack play a major role in determining the aircraft flight characteristics 
at stall. 
<P>Stall characteristics are important. The pilot should have a warning that the 
stall is about to occur. At stall, the loss of lift should be gradual and the 
airplane should remain controllable. Stall is caused by flow separation on the 
wing. The characteristics of the stall will be associated with the initial flow 
separation location and the manner in which the separation develops as the angle 
of attack is increased. Mild wing stall is associated with a separation that 
occurs at the upper surface trailing edge, which then moves forward with 
increasing angle of attack in a systematic, smooth fashion. In addition, this 
type of stall will lead to flow unsteadiness that the pilot will sense as a 
buffeting of the airplane prior to stall. This can frequently be observed as 
model vibration during wind tunnel tests. For the aircraft to remain 
controllable, the ailerons should remain effective at stall. This can be a 
problem, and is a key consideration in aerodynamic wing design. 
<P>Abrupt stall characteristics are the result of a sudden separation at the 
wing leading edge, leading to separation over the entire upper surface of the 
wing. This type of stall provides little warning to the pilot. The loss of lift 
is large due to the massive flow separation. Wing flow separation 
characteristics can be examined directly using surface flow visualization 
techniques, typically tufts, to observe the separation pattern, or inferred by 
examination of the force and moment characteristics. The airfoil section and 
wing planform, camber, and twist, determine the stall characteristics. 
<P>In addition to the lift characteristics, the character of the pitching moment 
must also be carefully examined at wing stall. It is quite likely that the 
pitching moment curve slope will change dramatically at stall. If the slope 
suddenly becomes unstable, the pitching moment behavior is termed an "unstable 
break," and the airplane will tend to pitch nose up at stall. At best this is 
undesirable, and if insufficient control authority is available to bring the 
nose down the airplane will suffer a departure from controlled flight, possibly 
leading to a spin. If the pitching moment curve has a "stable break" the wing 
design is likely to be acceptable from a stability and control standpoint. For 
complete aircraft many factors other than the isolated wing characteristics 
influence the pitching moment behavior near stall.

<P>Key issues in testing a wing in a wind tunnel to predict full scale flight 
performance are the problem of maintaining Reynolds number similarity, 
accounting for possible flow nonuniformities in the wind tunnel, and making 
corrections to the wind tunnel data to account for the effects of the wind 
tunnel walls and the effect of the model support system on the measurements. In 
most cases the full scale flight conditions will result in turbulent flow. In 
wind tunnels the low Reynolds number may result in a significant amount of 
laminar flow. To achieve a boundary layer similar to the one that exists at the 
flight Reynolds number, the boundary layer is frequently "tripped" to force 
transition to turbulent flow. A discussion of forcing boundary layer transition 
by "tripping" (known as "fixing," because the boundary layer transition location 
is known to be at a specified <I>fixed</I> location) is provided in <A 
href="http://www.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3054/manual/app3/index.html" 
target=_parent>Appendix 3</A>. 
<P>The flow in the wind tunnel is not perfectly uniform. To account for flow 
angularity, the experimental data taken in the test must be corrected after the 
test (this is sometimes built into the data reduction systems for modern online 
real time data reduction systems). The correction depends on the wind tunnel 
user knowing the flow angularity. Other wind tunnel corrections are also 
discussed in <A 
href="http://www.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3054/manual/app3/index.html" 
target=_parent>Appendix 3</A>, which is based on the book by Barlow, Rae and 
Pope, <A

<CENTER><FONT size=4><A name=T3>3. Special Considerations for Ocean 
Engineers</A></FONT></CENTER><BR>Aerodynamic testing procedures also generally 
apply directly to testing in water. However, two special features associated 
with fluid mechanics of vehicles moving in water are different and need to be 
understood. They are cavitation and ventilation. This section defines these 
phenomena, and is taken from the survey book edited by Schenck, <A 
href="http://www.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3054/manual/expt7/text.html#T10">Ref. 
4</A>. That book should be consulted for further information. 
<P><I>Cavitation</I>: This occurs most frequently on propellers. However, it can 
also occur on high performance hydrofoils. Whenever the ambient pressure at a 
point in the liquid equals or falls below the vapor pressure, the liquid will 
begin to "boil" and cavitation bubbles will appear. The bubbles move to areas of 
higher pressure and collapse. If they collapse while in contract with the 
propeller, the surface will become eroded. The accumulation of bubbles on the 
propeller surface will form a vapor cavity. Since the water is no longer in 
contact with the blade, this part of the blade will not produce any thrust and 
the propeller performance will be reduced. Similarly, lift is lost on a 
hydrofoil. The effects of cavitation on the propeller are thus reduced thrust 
and efficiency, and erosion of the propeller surface. Furthermore, noise is 
generated by the collapse of cavitation bubbles. 
<P>A typical sequence in the development of cavitation on a propeller begins at 
a tip vortex and spreads down the leading edge on the back (or <I>suction</I> 
side) of the propeller to the root of the blade. It then progresses along the 
back surface to the trailing edge until the whole back surface is enveloped by a 
cavity. A cone vortex is also formed at the end of the hub. At this time the 
thrust is wholly generated by the positive pressure acting on the face of the 
propeller. 
<P>Operation under cavitating conditions should be avoided, and in the design of 
a propeller this has to be checked. Most of the information on the cavitation 
characteristics of propellers is obtained from model tests. They are typically 
conducted in cavitation tunnels where the ambient pressure can be reduced to 
properly scale the cavitation number. 
<P><I>Ventilation</I>: Any surface-piercing foil system tends to suffer from 
<I>air entrainment</I>. This is generally known as <I>ventilation</I> and also 
called <I>entry</I>. Ventilation by a hydrofoil is usually an unmitigated 
nuisance. It arises from the fact that the hydrodynamic pressure over the top of 
the foil is considerably below atmospheric pressure, so that any air that is 
offered the chance of being sucked into this region will rush in immediately. 
The result is a sudden and severe loss of lift. In bad cases the effect is as if 
the foil had broken off. If the supply of air is limited, or if it rushes in for 
only a brief moment of time, a single transient bubble forms on the dorsal 
surface of the foil and is shed into the slipstream. The effect is as if the 
ship had run over a rut. A much more serious situation occurs when air can enter 
continuously. This has often posed a problem in the development of a foil 
mounted on a hollow strut, or a variable-incidence foil driven by a push-pull 
rod, because these arrangements tend to provide a path for the air. It is 
endemic in all surface-piercing foils by their very nature, because air can leak 
in down the surface of the foil itself. Low fences or screens running chordwise 
on struts and foils are used to stop this leakage.

<P>The Clark Y airfoil is named after Col. Virginius E. Clark, who designed many 
airfoils around the time of World War I. The Clark Y was designed in 1922. One 
of its distinguishing features is its flat lower surface from 30% chord to the 
trailing edge. This airfoil was widely used, but has been superseded by improved 
airfoils today. This is the airfoil used in the wing to be tested in this lab. 
<P>Tabulated coordinates for the Clark Y airfoil, from Riegels (<A

for experiment 7 is more extensive and specific than for any other.&nbsp; It is 
important, therefore, to get organized to distribute the work load <I>well in 
advance</I> of the experiment.&nbsp; 
<P>In a commercial aerodynamic test, one of the major items that must be 
prepared ahead of time is a pretest report (which in your case will be contained 
in the preparation sheet of your logbook). This document provides not only a run 
schedule, but includes specific estimates of the items that are being measured. 
A test would not be allowed to begin without such a report being filed. As the 
test proceeds, data is plotted over the pretest estimates as it is collected. 
This allows measurement and test problems to be detected at the earliest 
possible opportunity. The goal of the preparation for experiment 7 is the 
generation of just such a report. To prepare for this experiment you will need 
to:</P>

<CENTER><FONT size=4><A name=T72>7.2 Conducting the 
Test</A></FONT></CENTER><BR>The plan developed in the team pretest report should 
be used to conduct the test. With the pretest estimates and the test plan 
defined, the testing can begin. Follow the test plan, using the pretest 
estimates to evaluate the results. Before starting the test, carefully inspect 
the installation to make sure the model is installed properly, and that it is 
safe to begin the test. When identifying possible problems, consider the model 
installation, the basic tunnel instrumentation, and the wind tunnel data 
reduction program. Before leaving the test make sure that you have all the test 
data and details of the test necessary to write the test report. Make sure to 
transfer a copy of your logbook to your TA (by email or through the Wind Tunnel 
Engineer, as appropriate). Note that you are on your own for this test (under 
the watchful eye of the wind tunnel engineer). Your TA will not be present.

<CENTER><FONT size=4><A name=T73>7.3 Post Test 
Analysis</A></FONT></CENTER><BR>Once the data has been obtained, and plotted 
during the test to check that the test objectives are being met, a post test 
analysis should be conducted. This includes checking the data plotted and 
assessing the results as compared with the pretest estimates and objectives. 
Consider adjusting the data based on the flow angularity plots for the test 
section contained in Appendix 3. Make (and document) any other corrections to 
the data you feel are required.
